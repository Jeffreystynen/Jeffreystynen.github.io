                                During the requirements analysis course, I acquired hands-on experience 
                                in translating client requirements into functional prototypes. This opportunity 
                                honed my ability to effectively communicate with clients, particularly those 
                                lacking technical expertise. Our project involved developing a functional prototype 
                                alongside a corresponding database model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project's objective was to develop an application aimed at supporting individuals 
                                in the early stages of dementia. Our goal was to provide them with a comprehensive tool 
                                to track appointments, medications, and symptoms. My responsibilities included collaborative 
                                work on designing the database structure and creating the visual and navigational framework 
                                for CRUD operations within the calendar interface. Throughout the process, I prioritized 
                                user accessibility and considered the unique needs of our target audience. In the Image below
                                you can find the database scheme of the application.

                                As part of the Project PHP course, our team developed the application 
                                described above. For this project, my primary focus was on designing 
                                and implementing the prescription management pages. These pages allow 
                                patients to seamlessly add, edit, and remove prescriptions from their accounts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This hands-on experience provided invaluable insights into advanced technologies 
                                such as Livewire, MVC architecture, and database operations. Through this project, 
                                I deepened my understanding of modern web development frameworks and honed my skills 
                                in efficient database management. In the images below, you can see some of the work I did
                                during the project. If you wish to visit the actual project, you can click this <a href="https://lsta.meminder.be">link</a>

                            <p>
                                During the "Could AI" course, I engaged in comprehensive data analysis 
                                and forecasting exercises utilizing two distinct datasets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the datasets we delved into was the renowned Titanic dataset. 
                                Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in utilizing powerful 
                                tools such as Pandas and Seaborn for data cleaning and analysis. Our objective 
                                was to derive valuable insights from the dataset, ultimately enabling us to 
                                calculate the probability of survival.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In another project, we focused on analyzing a dataset related to crop 
                                yields. Our aim was to develop predictive models for forecasting future 
                                crop yields. This endeavor involved leveraging technologies including Pandas, 
                                AWS, and Seaborn to manipulate and analyze the data effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this team project we all engaged in the different datasets and models.
                                This allowed us to learn the entire process and compare the results to gain a better understanding of the subject.
                                What I contributed to the final rusult can be found in the titanic notebook in <a href="https://github.com/HannahCimene/TrioData_Masters">this GitHub repository</a> 
                                where I took the liberty to combine all of
                                our ideas together and forge a well structured notbook with a robust model to calculate the probability of survival.

                                I've successfully finished CS50AI, an online introduction 
                                to artificial intelligence offered by Harvard University through edX. 
                                This rigorous course encompasses twelve challenging projects covering a 
                                broad spectrum of AI topics, ranging from search algorithms to advanced 
                                language models. Through this experience, I've deepened my understanding of 
                                AI principles and refined my problem-solving abilities. I'm thrilled to leverage 
                                the knowledge gained from this course in my future endeavors within the field of
