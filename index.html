                            I am an ambitious graduate in the field of applied computer science. 
                            I aim to become a data engineer because of my passion for data and 
                            optimizing processes combined with my interests in mathematics and 
                            artificial intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy reading classical 
                            literature, playing the guitar, and playing video games. My interest 
                            in optimizing processes is reflected in the games I play, such as 
                            Factorio and Satisfactory, where I can build complex automated 
                            systems and optimize them to run as efficiently as possible.

                        <h4>Mobilab&Care</h4> 
                        <p> 
                            Between 28/02 and 06/06, I completed a 15-week internship at 
                            Mobilab&Care, a research group at Thomas More Geel focused on 
                            healthcare and mobility. 
                        </p> 
                        <p> 
                            During my internship, I developed 
                            a beta version of a decision support system for cardiologists 
                            and researchers. The goal was to create an interface that allows 
                            users to input patient data and receive model predictions to 
                            assist in determining optimal drug and dosage recommendations. 
                        </p> 
                        <p> 
                            The system was built using Python and Flask, with a modular 
                            microservice architecture for scalability and maintainability. 
                            I implemented core features such as model interaction, training 
                            pipelines, and user input handling. Common functionality—like 
                            database access and visualization—was abstracted into reusable 
                            service layers. 
                        </p> 
                        <p> Due to limited access to clinical data, 
                            development was based on a dummy dataset. This allowed me to 
                            focus on designing a scalable, secure, and flexible system 
                            architecture, ready for future integration of real-world 
                            medical data and production-ready models. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Course Overview</h5>
                        <p>
                          During my final year, I took the online course 
                          <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/fat-chance-probability-ground">Fat Chance: 
                          Probability from the Ground Up</a>, offered by Harvard 
                          University through edX. The course was designed to teach 
                          the basics of probability in a clear and practical way. It 
                          used real-life examples to explain how chance works and how 
                          we can use it to make better decisions.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Topics Covered</h5>
                        <p>
                          The course began with basic counting methods, which are 
                          important for understanding how probability works. As the 
                          course continued, these ideas were expanded and used to 
                          solve more complex problems. Key topics included:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Basic and advanced counting techniques</li>
                            <li>Introduction to probability and how to calculate simple probabilities</li>
                            <li>Conditional probability and how one event can affect another</li>
                            <li>Expected value and how to understand the average result of many trials</li>
                            <li>Bernoulli trials – repeated experiments with two possible outcomes</li>
                            <li>The normal distribution and how it is used to estimate probabilities in real life</li>
                            <li>Using probability to understand and work with uncertainty</li>
                          </ul>
                          The course used visual lessons and real-life examples to explain each 
                          concept in a way that was clear and easy to follow.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What I Learned</h5>
                        <p>
                          By the end of the course, I had gained a more refined understanding
                          of probability and statistics and its applications. This knowledge
                          has changed my perspective on how I approach problems and make decisions,
                          with a more mathamatical mindset. This course, so far, has helped me
                          during several projects, such as the ANPR monitoring system and my 
                          internship at Mobilab&Care.

                        <p>
                          During my internship at Mobilab&Care, I enrolled in the online 
                          course <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/labs-initiatives/sil/research/methods/ai-machine-learning/short-course">Machine Learning & Causal Inference: A Short Course</a> 
                          offered by Stanford Graduate School of Business. This course introduced 
                          the core concepts of machine learning and how they can be applied to 
                          understand cause-and-effect relationships in data. It provided me with 
                          a strong foundation in both areas, which I was able to apply during my 
                          internship projects.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Topics Covered</h5>
                        <p>
                          This course focused on how machine learning can be used to 
                          understand cause-and-effect relationships in real-world data. 
                          It combined ideas from economics, statistics, and computer science. 
                          Key topics included:

                        <h5>What I Learned</h5>
                        <p>
                          This was a challenging course for me, as it required a 
                          background in statistics and econometrics. While I was not able
                          to follow every concept in full detail, I gained a solid 
                          overview of the main ideas in causal inference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I learned the difference between correlation and causation, and 
                          how confounding can affect the results of a study. I also 
                          understood what Average Treatment Effects (ATE) are and how 
                          Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) can be estimated 
                          using advanced techniques like double robust methods. These 
                          concepts were new to me, but very eye-opening.
                        </p>

                          My earlier course, <em>Fat Chance: Probability from the Ground 
                          Up</em>, helped me understand the statistical thinking 
                          behind many of the lessons. Thanks to this course, I was 
                          also able to better understand the data analysis and 
                          evaluation work I did during my internship at Mobilab&Care.

                        <h5>Course Overview</h5>
                        <p>
                          During my internship at Mobilab&Care, I followed an online 
                          course <a href="https://kube.academy/paths/kubernetes-core-concepts">Kubernetes Core Concepts</a> offered by KubeAcademy. The course was 
                          divided into five parts and provided a hands-on introduction 
                          to the core concepts of Kubernetes. It helped me understand 
                          how to containerize, deploy, manage, and secure applications 
                          in a Kubernetes environment. This knowledge was valuable when 
                          I worked on designing a deployment architecture during my 
                          internship.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Topics Covered</h5>
                        <p>
                          The course was broad and practical, covering many essential aspects of 
                          Kubernetes. Main topics included:
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cloud-Native Infrastructure:</strong> Understanding the basics of containerization and how Kubernetes fits into modern application deployment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Management:</strong> Deploying and updating applications, handling configurations, and managing the full application lifecycle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cluster Networking:</strong> Managing multiple applications within a cluster and understanding how traffic is routed between them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Using persistent storage, managing environment-specific configurations, and deploying more complex applications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Workloads and Security:</strong> Exploring different types of workloads (not just servers) and applying key security principles for safe deployments.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Each lesson included hands-on labs, which helped reinforce the 
                          material and make the learning more practical.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What I Learned</h5>
                        <p>
                          Before taking this course, I had already completed an 
                          introductory course on Kubernetes, so I was familiar with 
                          the basics. However, this course went deeper into core concepts 
                          and gave me a more practical understanding of how Kubernetes 
                          works in real scenarios.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Although the course did not focus specifically on system 
                          architecture, I took it to support my work on a deployment 
                          diagram during my internship. The knowledge I gained—especially 
                          around workloads, application lifecycle, configuration, and 
                          security—helped me make more informed decisions when designing 
                          that architecture. The hands-on labs were especially useful in 
                          reinforcing how different Kubernetes features interact in 
                          practice.

                        <h5>Project Goal</h5> 
                        <p> 
                            The goal of this project was to enhance the monitoring and 
                            diagnostic capabilities of ANPR cameras by introducing a 
                            priority-based alert classification system. This helps reduce 
                            alert fatigue for system administrators and ensures faster response 
                            to critical issues. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project Realisation</h5> 
                        <p> We developed a .NET application that provides an overview of all 
                            ANPR cameras and their error statuses. To support this, we built 
                            the necessary infrastructure, including a backend on AWS and secure 
                            communication via Tailscale VPN. We implemented a system to classify 
                            error messages by priority and monitored electrical components such 
                            as power supplies and fuses. Diagnostic data was collected from IoT 
                            devices and used to trigger alerts in the dashboard application. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>My Contribution</h5> 
                        <p> 
                            I partly contributed to the Raspberry Pi integration used for monitoring 
                            electrical components. My main focus was on designing the data handling 
                            and alert prioritization system. Instead of using a computationally heavy 
                            AI approach (like machine learning or neural networks), I applied a 
                            rule-based method inspired by things I learned from calculus. This mathematical 
                            approach allowed us to evaluate error conditions using weighted scores. 
                            It resulted in a system that is not only faster but also more 
                            cost-efficient to run.

                        <h5>Project Goal</h5>
                        <p>
                          In this project, we built a self-driving car model for Forza
                          Horizon 4. Our aim was to create an autonomous system that can 
                          drive the car on virtual roads using deep learning. We also 
                          developed a separate object detection model with YOLO to spot 
                          other vehicles and obstacles. Although running both models at 
                          the same time wasn't possible because of hardware limits, each 
                          part helped us learn more about different aspects of autonomous 
                          driving.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project Realisation</h5>
                        <p>
                          We started by collecting data with a custom script that captured 
                          screenshots of the game every 0.5 seconds. To focus on the road, 
                          we cropped out the top 30% of each image. We then enhanced the 
                          images by rotating, zooming, and adjusting brightness. One 
                          challenge was that most images showed straight roads, so we 
                          duplicated images with sharp turns to help the model learn how 
                          to handle them. After cleaning and preparing the data, we trained 
                          our model using a ResNet architecture. Through several training 
                          rounds and adjustments, the model learned to drive the car 
                          smoothly in different conditions.
                        </p>
                        <h5>My Contribution</h5>
                        <p>
                          I was responsible for gathering and cleaning the game data, 
                          ensuring that each image was paired with the correct controller 
                          inputs. I built a program that converts the model’s output into 
                          real controller actions, such as steering angles and throttle 
                          values. By repeating images of sharp turns, I helped balance our 
                          dataset so the model could learn to handle curves better. This 
                          hands-on work not only improved my deep learning skills but also 
                          taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and problem solving.

                        <p>
                          In this project, we built a personalized learning assistant that 
                          can take PDF documents and answer questions about their content. 
                          Using CrewAI, Streamlit, and Groq’s language model, our goal was 
                          to create a tool that shows how to turn uploaded PDFs into an 
                          interactive Q&A experience. Inspired by Akansha Saxena, we aimed 
                          to tackle both the technical and practical challenges of 
                          connecting document processing with dynamic question answering.

                        <p>
                          We built the project by first using Streamlit to create a simple 
                          chat interface and file uploader. Users can easily upload PDF 
                          files, which are then processed by our assistant. The system 
                          uses CrewAI to manage two agents: one to ingest and store content 
                          from the PDFs into a vector database (using ChromaDB) and the 
                          other to answer questions based on that stored data. Communication 
                          between these components is handled via a Retrieval-Augmented 
                          Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates Groq’s language model 
                          for generating context-aware responses. We also developed tools 
                          like ProcessFile and ProcessInput to ensure smooth handling of 
                          file uploads and chat interactions.

                        <h5>My Contribution</h5>
                        <p>
                          In this project, my main contribution was developing the tools 
                          that our agents rely on to complete their tasks. I created the 
                          ProcessFile tool, which manages PDF uploads by temporarily storing 
                          each file, reading its contents, and feeding the data into our 
                          vector database. I also built the ProcessInput tool, which captures 
                          user queries from the Streamlit chat interface, passes them to our 
                          system, and retrieves relevant information using our 
                          Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline. These tools streamlined 
                          content ingestion and question answering, allowing our agents to 
                          work together smoothly and efficiently.

                        <h5>Project Goal</h5>
                        <p>
                          The goal of the Meminder project was to create an application that helps people in the early stages of dementia.
                          The app is designed to track appointments, medications, and symptoms, providing a simple and clear tool that reminds users of their daily tasks.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project Realisation</h5>
                        <p>
                          The project was developed in two phases. First, during the Requirements Analysis course, our team built a working prototype.
                          We translated client needs into a functional design and created a matching database model along with a user-friendly calendar interface that allows for easy Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
                          This phase emphasized clear communication and understanding non-technical client requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Later, as part of the Project PHP course, we further developed the application by focusing on the prescription management pages.
                          These pages enable patients to seamlessly add, edit, and remove prescriptions.
                          This development phase provided hands-on experience with advanced technologies such as Livewire, MVC architecture, and efficient database operations—all of which deepened our understanding of modern web development frameworks.
                        </p>
                        <h5>My Contribution</h5>
                        <p>
                          My contributions spanned both phases of the project. During the requirements analysis phase, I collaborated on designing the database structure and building the visual and navigational aspects of the calendar interface.
                          I paid close attention to making the app accessible and easy to use, and I actively participated in client discussions to ensure our design met their needs.
                          In the development phase, I focused on creating and implementing the prescription management pages, integrating them smoothly within the system.
                          This work helped me hone my skills in web development and database management while also ensuring that the final product was both robust and user-friendly.

                        <h5>Project Goal</h5>
                        <p>
                          The goal of the Cloud AI project was to improve our data 
                          analysis and forecasting skills by working with real-world 
                          datasets. We aimed to develop predictive models that provide 
                          meaningful insights, such as calculating survival probabilities 
                          and forecasting crop yields.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project Realisation</h5>
                        <p>
                          For this project, I worked with two main datasets. With the 
                          famous Titanic dataset, we used tools like Pandas and Seaborn 
                          for cleaning and analysis, aiming to calculate the probability 
                          of survival. In another part, we analyzed a crop yields dataset 
                          using technologies such as Pandas, AWS, and Seaborn to build 
                          models that predict future yields. Working as a team, we 
                          explored various techniques and compared our results to better 
                          understand the subject.
                        </p>
                        <h5>My Contribution</h5>
                        <p>
                          I focused on the Titanic dataset, where I combined our team’s 
                          ideas to create a well-structured notebook with a robust model 
                          for calculating survival probability. You can check out my work 
                          in <a href="https://github.com/HannahCimene/TrioData_Masters" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. This project not only deepened my 
                          data analysis skills but also enhanced my ability to work 
                          collaboratively in a real-world setting.

                        <h5>Course Overview</h5> 
                        <p> Alongside my academic studies in Artificial Intelligence, I 
                            completed <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/">CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</a> 
                            (CS50AI), an online course offered by Harvard University through 
                            edX. This course was complementary to my degree, 
                            offering a more hands-on and technical perspective on how AI systems 
                            are built and function. Through twelve applied projects, I explored 
                            a range of AI techniques such as search, optimization, machine 
                            learning, and natural language processing.

                        <h5>What I Learned</h5> 
                        <p> 
                            CS50AI was a challenging but rewarding course. Many of the projects 
                            pushed me to think deeply about how different AI techniques work 
                            in practice. I learned how agents make decisions through search 
                            and inference, how to build models that can learn from data, and 
                            how language can be processed computationally. While the course was 
                            demanding at times, it gave me a solid foundation in AI and improved my 
                            confidence in writing intelligent programs. The hands-on approach and 
                            Python-based implementation helped bridge the gap between theory 
                            and application.

                        <h5>Study Overview</h5> 
                        <p> 
                            Out of personal interest, I began working through the Calculus 
                            textbook by Adams (9th edition, Pearson). Although this was not 
                            part of a formal course, I chose to study it independently in my 
                            spare time because a strong foundation in mathematics is essential 
                            in computer science. 
                        </p> 
                        <p> 
                            So far, I have completed roughly 
                            one-third of the book. This self-study is helping me gain a 
                            deeper understanding of key mathematical ideas and has already 
                            improved the way I approach problems in technical subjects.

                        <p> 
                            Working through this material has increased my mathematical 
                            maturity, especially when it comes to formal reasoning and abstract 
                            thinking. I found some sections challenging, but the effort has paid 
                            off by strengthening my grasp of important concepts such as limits, 
                            derivatives, and integrals. These ideas are foundational in areas 
                            like optimization, differential equations, and even aspects of 
                            machine learning.

                            This study has also helped me better understand topics in other 
                            courses, particularly the Stanford course on causal inference, which 
                            required a more statistical background. Thanks to the calculus work 
                            I’ve done here, I was better prepared to engage with ideas like 
                            expected value, rates of change, and function behavior.
